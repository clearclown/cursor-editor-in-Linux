# About Cursor AI Editor

## What is Cursor?

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor designed to enhance developer productivity by integrating advanced artificial intelligence features directly into a familiar coding environment. It's a fork of Visual Studio Code with additional AI capabilities like code generation, smart rewrites, and codebase queries.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Assistance
- **Code Generation**: Write code using natural language instructions
- **Context-Aware Autocompletion**: Predicts multi-line edits based on recent changes
- **Smart Rewrites**: Update multiple lines of code simultaneously
- **Codebase Queries**: Ask questions about your code in natural language
- **Predictive Coding**: Suggests code based on what you're trying to accomplish

### VS Code Integration
- **Extension Compatibility**: Works with most VS Code extensions
- **Familiar Interface**: Uses the same UI and shortcuts as VS Code
- **Theme Support**: Compatible with VS Code themes
- **Settings Migration**: Import existing VS Code settings and preferences

- 64-bit operating system
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB+ recommended)
- 1GB disk space
- Internet connection for AI features

## Cursor vs. Alternatives

### Advantages of Cursor
- Deep AI integration in a familiar VS Code environment
- Advanced code generation capabilities
- Smart editing features that understand context
- Support for various AI models

### Considerations
- Requires internet connection for most AI features
- Some advanced features require a paid subscription
- Privacy concerns with code being sent to remote servers (unless using Privacy Mode)

## Why This Launcher?

While Cursor is a powerful tool for developers, running it on Linux can be challenging due to:

1. AppImage distribution format requiring special handling
2. Wayland compatibility issues
3. Path resolution problems
4. System integration limitations

This launcher script addresses these issues, providing a seamless experience for Linux users who want to benefit from Cursor's AI capabilities while maintaining system compatibility.
